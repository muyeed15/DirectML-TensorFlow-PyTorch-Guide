# DirectML Setup on Windows (TensorFlow 2 & PyTorch)

This guide provides detailed instructions for setting up DirectML natively on Windows for TensorFlow 2 and PyTorch. DirectML is a high-performance, hardware-accelerated DirectX 12 library for machine learning. It provides GPU acceleration for common machine learning tasks across a broad range of supported hardware and drivers, including all DirectX 12-capable GPUs.

## Requirements

### Operating Systems
- **Windows 10 Version 1709** (Build 16299 or higher), 64-bit
- **Windows 11 Version 21H2** (Build 22000 or higher), 64-bit

### Supported GPUs
- **AMD**: Radeon R5/R7/R9 2xx series or newer
- **Intel**: HD Graphics 5xx or newer
- **NVIDIA**: GeForce GTX 9xx series GPU or newer

## Installation Steps

### 1. Download and Install Miniconda

Open a command prompt (ensure it is not running as Administrator) and execute the following commands to download and install Miniconda:

```cmd
curl https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86_64.exe -o miniconda.exe
start /wait "" miniconda.exe /S
del miniconda.exe
```

### 2. Set Up the Conda Environment

Open the "Anaconda Prompt (miniconda3)" (not PowerShell) and create and activate a new Conda environment named `directml` with Python 3.10.14:

```cmd
conda create --name "directml" python==3.10.14
conda activate "directml"
```

### 3. Install TensorFlow with DirectML

In the activated Conda environment, install TensorFlow and the DirectML plugin using pip:

```cmd
pip install tensorflow-cpu==2.17.0
pip install tensorflow-directml-plugin==0.4.0.dev230202
```

### 4. Install PyTorch with DirectML

Similarly, install PyTorch with DirectML in the same Conda environment:

```cmd
pip install torch-directml==0.2.4.dev240815
```

## Usage

### TensorFlow with DirectML

To verify that TensorFlow is working correctly with DirectML, run the following Python script:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

cifar = tf.keras.datasets.cifar100
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = cifar.load_data()
model = tf.keras.applications.ResNet50(
    include_top=True,
    weights=None,
    input_shape=(32, 32, 3),
    classes=100,
)

loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=False)
model.compile(optimizer="adam", loss=loss_fn, metrics=["accuracy"])
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5, batch_size=64)
```

### PyTorch with DirectML

To verify that PyTorch is working with DirectML, run the following Python script:

```python
import torch
import torch_directml

dml = torch_directml.device()

tensor1 = torch.tensor([1]).to(dml)
tensor2 = torch.tensor([2]).to(dml)

dml_algebra = tensor1 + tensor2
print(dml_algebra.item())
```

### Monitoring GPU Usage

While running your DirectML-based scripts, you can monitor GPU usage using the Task Manager:

1. **Open Task Manager**: Press `Ctrl + Shift + Esc`.
2. **Navigate to the Performance Tab**: Click on the "Performance" tab.
3. **Select GPU**: In the left sidebar, select your GPU.
4. **Change the View**: In the GPU tab, change one of the graphs to "Compute 0", "Compute 1", etc., to monitor GPU computation usage.
5. **Check Dedicated GPU Memory**: Observe "Dedicated GPU Memory" usage to see how much memory your TensorFlow or PyTorch tasks are using.

## Notes

- The specific version numbers provided are tailored to this setup and might change in the future. Ensure compatibility if you use newer versions of TensorFlow, PyTorch, or DirectML.
- Always verify your hardware compatibility, especially if using older or newer GPUs.

This setup will allow you to leverage GPU acceleration on Windows with TensorFlow and PyTorch via DirectML, enabling high-performance machine learning tasks on a wide range of hardware.
